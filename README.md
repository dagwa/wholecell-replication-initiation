This represents the *Replication Initiation* module of the whole-cell model published by [Karr *et al.*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817898)

There is a [Wiki](https://github.com/dagwa/wholecell-replication-initiation/wiki) where we keep notes about our work on this module.

More information about files in the repo, one can find in the folders' README files.
