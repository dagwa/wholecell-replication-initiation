### Tests

This folder contains JavaScript tests for 2 of the sub models
which have been already implemented:
1) activation
2) reactivation
It's too difficult to create such kind of tests for other models now,
because they use stochastic elements generators and it's impossible to cover
all possibilities for them.
Tests should be run via BioUML after sbml or antimony model will be imported
in BioUML database.
